Django Arcitechture:

first new app..
url path
migration to create databases : for this app databases
create model means databases table model
make migration create migration file

> django shell for interactive shell to access current var, debug.


> admin interface is seperated for stuff so admin panel is available in django. here 
	you can add databases here.. its kinda cool..
	its a new thinking for me.
	- It's kind of new idea, user cann not create new model here, but can give entry of data here.

	: So first need to watch other's work.

> Starting apps vs project
	adding this app in setting


Homework:
	- by learning vote project, I can extend the same idea first then I can build my own project.
	- take this key ideas here and think about your readwise apps.
	- first I've to build user and Notes model.
